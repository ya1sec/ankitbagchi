        I have bad news. This collection of hypertext elements has been
        solicited by those seeking to learn about my life and unfinished business. They wish
        to make an employee out of me.

        I run a multidisciplinary solo practice that goes by the name
        <a href="https://ya1sec.com" target="_blank" class="y1s">ya1sec</a>,
        where I wear the following hats:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Frontend Developer</li>
        <li>Designer [graphic + ux]</li>
        <li>Video Editor</li>
        <li>???</li>
      </ol>

        Lately, I've been exploring the domain of Natural Language Processing
        and working on a miniature piece of software called
        <a href="https://github.com/ya1sec/korpis" target="_blank" class="proj"
          >KORPIS</a
        >
        that aims to be a friend to poets. Heaps of text are generated by Markov
        Models trained on austere corpora, leaving poets to use the age-old
        cutup method to create works using the results. I'm writing a
        neverending poem called
        <a href="https://ya1sec.com/ioah.html" target="_blank" class="proj"
          >Impression of an Hour</a
        >
        in collaboration with an experimental version of the program.

        A group of volunteers working part-time to build a robust critical
        thinking tool that promotes intellectually honest discourse. My role as
        a Frontend Developer had to be cut short due to an increase in freelance
        work, but I'm including this anyway in case my reader finds this
        idea interesting and uses or shares this tool.
